Node packages used
* Axios, fs, dotenv
* Momentjs, node-spotify-api


The hard part was checking for errors with returned data. It is still a struggle to know where to put things, but I learned a lot about try and catch. I also learned to prevent errors with coding checks before the function gets too far. 


I'm glad to have learned how to keep API keys secret using dotenv and a keys file. It opens the door to using more databases that require a little more security.


There's a fun section of file information sharing with the "do-what-it-says" option, it reads random text and starts up one of the search calls.
